Exercise Description:

Your task is to create a basic iOS app with three views: profile, home, and a crypto page. The app must have a bottom navigation bar, a login/signup screen with email validation, and a setting that changes the entire app language.

View Details:

    •    Profile View: This view should display the user's profile information, such as name, email, and profile picture. You can use any dummy data you like for this view.
    •    Home View: This view should display the user's account balance and recent transactions. You can use any dummy data you like for this view.
    •    Crypto View: This view should have three buttons for purchasing, sending, and selling crypto. You can use any dummy data you like for this view.
Navigation:

    •    The bottom navigation bar should have three items corresponding to the three views: Profile, Home, and Crypto.
    •    The app should have a login/signup screen with email validation. The user should be able to log in or sign up using their email address.
    •    The app should have a setting that allows the user to change the entire app language. The language setting should persist between app launches.
Technical Requirements:

    •    The app should be built in Swift 5 or later.
    •    The app should use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
    •    The app should use Auto Layout to ensure it looks good on different screen sizes and orientations.
    •    The app should use Interface Builder and/or programmatic UI to create the views and layout.
    •    The app should use Cocoa Pods or Swift Package Manager for any third-party dependencies.
Bonus Points:

    •    Use Core Data to persist user data, such as the user's profile information and recent transactions.
    •    Use Keychain to securely store the user's login credentials.
    •    Use a third-party API to get real account balance and transaction data for the Home View.
    •    Use MVVM or VIPER design pattern.
    •    Use Localizations to make the app multilingual.
Submission Guidelines:

    •    Please submit your code via a GitHub repository or a ZIP file.
    •    Your code should include instructions on how to run the app and any necessary setup steps.
    •    Your code should be well-organized, documented, and easy to follow.
    •    Your code should adhere to best practices and be optimized for performance.
