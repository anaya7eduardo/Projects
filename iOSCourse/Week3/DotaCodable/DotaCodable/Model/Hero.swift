     Codable types can declare a special nested enumeration named CodginKeys that conforms to the CodingKey protocol. When this enumeration is present, it's cases serve as the authoritative list of properties that must be included when instances of a codable type are encoded or decoded. The names of the enumeration cases should match the names you've given to the corresponding properties in your type.
